      <p>GOOD EVENING
        1. First of all, I would like to thank PlanetSpark for considering me for this opportunity.
        
        3. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rao Athar Khan, and I am currently in my fourth year of pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology from the College of Engineering Roorkee.
        
        5. I would also like to express my gratitude to Eshita Singh ma'am, the recruiter who has been guiding me throughout this process.
        
        7. Now, coming to the first question, my preferred job role at PlanetSpark is Sales. I have always been fascinated by the art of building relationships, connecting with people, and driving business growth. 
        
        9. I have developed a strong passion for sales, so the Sales role aligns perfectly with my skills, experiences, and career aspirations.
        
        11. I am confident that my dedication, enthusiasm will enable me to make a positive impact on the company's success.
